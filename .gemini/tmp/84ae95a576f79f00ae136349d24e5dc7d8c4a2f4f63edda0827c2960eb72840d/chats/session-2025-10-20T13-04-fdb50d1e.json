My initial thought is to employ `lsof` - it's the standard tool for this on macOS, so it seems like the most straightforward starting point. Specifically, I'll use `lsof -i :3001` to get a list of relevant process information, which I can then parse to isolate the PID. I'm confident I can then use that ID to perform other related actions.",
