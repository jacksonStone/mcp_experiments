      "content": "The best way to update Node.js depends on how you installed it. Here are the most common methods:\n\n### Using a Node Version Manager (nvm)\n\nThis is the recommended method for developers as it allows you to manage multiple versions of Node.js on your system.\n\n1.  **Install nvm** (if you don't have it):\n    ```bash\n    curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.3/install.sh | bash\n    ```\n    You may need to restart your terminal after installation.\n\n2.  **Install the latest version of Node.js**:\n    ```bash\n    nvm install node\n    ```\n\n3.  **Switch to the new version**:\n    ```bash\n    nvm use node\n    ```\n\n### Using the Official Installer\n\nIf you're not managing multiple versions, you can download the latest installer from the [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/). Running the installer will update your current version.\n\n### Using Homebrew (macOS)\n\nIf you installed Node.js with Homebrew:\n\n1.  **Update Homebrew**:\n    ```bash\n    brew update\n    ```\n\n2.  **Upgrade Node.js**:\n    ```bash\n    brew upgrade node\n    ```\n\nAfter updating, you can verify the new version by running `node -v` in your terminal.",
