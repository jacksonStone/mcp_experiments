      "content": "Yes, you can set a billing budget on your GCP billing account to monitor your costs and receive alerts. However, it's important to understand that a budget in GCP is a monitoring and alerting tool, not a hard cap that automatically stops services.\n\nTo get a hard limit, you need to combine the budget alerts with programmatic actions, like triggering a Cloud Function to disable billing or shut down resources.\n\nHere's a summary of how to set it up:\n\n1.  **Go to the Billing section** in the Google Cloud Console.\n2.  Navigate to **Budgets & alerts**.\n3.  **Create a new budget**, defining its scope (entire account or specific projects/services), the budget amount, and alert thresholds (e.g., at 50%, 90%, and 100% of your budget).\n4.  **Configure notifications**. You can have alerts sent via email or, for automation, to a Pub/Sub topic which can then trigger a Cloud Function.\n\nWould you like me to help you find a tutorial on how to set up the programmatic part with Cloud Functions?",
